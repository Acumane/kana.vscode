## Installation

I did not upload this to the VSCode Extension Marketplace, so you will need to install manually!

1. Download the `.vsix` file found in the `package` folder (or from the Releases tab on GitHub)
2. In a command line run `code --install-extension <path_to_vsix>`
    - The `code` command needs to be on your `PATH`, this should be an option when installing VSCode.

OR you can install directly from VSCode.

2. In the Extensions tab (CTRL + Shift + X), click the `...` in the top right corner.
3. Use the `Install from VSIX...` option to navigate to the downloaded file.
