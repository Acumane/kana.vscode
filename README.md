</div>

A dark theme for Code inspired by the colors of the famous painting by Katsushika Hokusai. Originally [kanagawa.nvim](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim), ported to Code by [@conner-calhoun](https://github.com/conner-calhoun).

Colors deviate from the original according to my personal preference (hence, **Kana**~~gawa~~). If you like what I do, check my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Acumane/dotfiles) for more Kana.


### Notes

- This theme supports semantic tokens; try using LSPs that provide them.
- I use this alongside modest [tweaks](https://github.com/Acumane/dotfiles/blob/linux/code/tweaks.css) to Code's CSS. You can import them with [this extension](https://github.com/be5invis/vscode-custom-css).
